This project involved deploying our QuantumGrid platform to provide a unified analytical capability for a critical national security mission. The primary challenge was the integration of over 50 disparate, high-volume data sources. We deployed a secure, air-gapped instance of QuantumGrid and developed custom data connectors. Key achievements include reducing data analysis time by 40%, fusing over 5 petabytes of data, and identifying three previously unknown high-risk threats within the first six months. The system has maintained a 99.99% availability rate.
