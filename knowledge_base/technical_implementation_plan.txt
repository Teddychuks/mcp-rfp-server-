Our standard implementation plan is a phased approach designed to minimize risk and accelerate time-to-value for our clients. A typical implementation follows these five phases:
1.  **Phase 1: Discovery & Planning (2 Weeks)**: Collaborative workshops with client stakeholders to define success criteria, identify data sources, and establish a detailed project plan and timeline.
2.  **Phase 2: Environment Setup & Configuration (4 Weeks)**: Deployment and hardening of the QuantumGrid platform within the client's designated cloud or on-premise environment.
3.  **Phase 3: Data Ingestion & Integration (6 Weeks)**: Development and configuration of data pipelines to ingest and process the initial set of priority data sources.
4.  **Phase 4: Model Tuning & User Training (4 Weeks)**: Configuration of AI/ML models to meet mission-specific requirements and comprehensive training for end-user analysts and administrators.
5.  **Phase 5: Go-Live & Operational Support (Ongoing)**: Transition to full operational status with ongoing support from our dedicated engineering team.
